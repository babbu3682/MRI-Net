# SMART-Net - Official Pytorch Implementation

We proposed a supervised multi-task aiding representation transfer learning network called <b>SMART-Net</b>.


## üí° Highlights
+ Develop a robust feature extractor of brain hemorrhage in head & neck NCCT through three kinds of
multi-task representation learning.
+ Propose the consistency loss to alleviate the disparity of two pretext tasks' heads, resulting in
improved transferability and representation.
Connect the feature extractor with the target-specific 3D operator via transfer learning to expand
volume-level tasks.
+ Explore relationships of the proposed multi-pretext task combinations and perform ablation studies on
optimal 3D operators for volume-level ICH tasks.
+ Validate the model on multiple datasets with previous methods and ablation studies for the robustness
and practicality of our method.

## Requirements
+ Linux
+ Python 3.8.5
+ PyTorch 1.8.0


## üì¶ SMART-Net Framework
### 1. Clone the repository and install dependencies
```bash
$ git clone https://github.com/babbu3682/SMART-Net.git
$ cd SMART-Net/
$ pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 2. Preparing data
#### For your convenience, we have provided few 3D nii samples from [Physionet publish dataset](https://physionet.org/content/ct-ich/1.3.1/) as well as their mask labels. 
#### Note: We do not use this data as a train, it is just for code publishing examples.

<!-- Download the data from [this repository](https://zenodo.org/record/4625321/files/TransVW_data.zip?download=1).  -->
You can use your own data using the [dicom2nifti](https://github.com/icometrix/dicom2nifti) for converting from dicom to nii.
